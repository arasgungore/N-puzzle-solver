# n-puzzle-solver

A C++ project which efficiently solves any given N-puzzle (aka 15 puzzle) using a backtracking algorithm on a decision tree.

The program will write all steps without blank spaces or newline characters. Starting from the initial configuration:
â€¢ For LEFT move, the program will write letter L,
â€¢ For RIGHT move, the program will write letter R,
â€¢ For UP move, the program will write letter U,
â€¢ For DOWN move, the program will write letter D on the terminal.



## Run on Terminal

```sh
g++ Header/*.cpp main.cpp -std=c++11 -o test
test
```
