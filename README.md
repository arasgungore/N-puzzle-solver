# n-puzzle-solver

A C++ project which efficiently solves any given N-puzzle (aka 15 puzzle) using a backtracking algorithm on a decision tree.



## Run on Terminal

```sh
g++ Header/*.cpp main.cpp -std=c++11 -o test
test
```



## Description

In this project, the main objective is developing a program that solves the puzzle
game, whose rules are as follows:

- Game table is anN xNtable whose cells are filled with numbers from 1
  to (N^2 âˆ’1), and the remaining one is blank.
- Only the blank box can be moved on the table and the moving direction
  can be either horizontal or vertical (diagonal moves are not possible).
- When the blank box is moved, the blank one and the box in the destination
  position of the blank box are swapped.



## Output

The program will write all steps without blank spaces or newline characters. Starting from the initial configuration:
- For LEFT move, the program will write letter L,
- For RIGHT move, the program will write letter R,
- For UP move, the program will write letter U,
- For DOWN move, the program will write letter D on the terminal.



## Further Notes

This project was assigned for the Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (CMPE 160) course on Spring 2019 semester.
Upon completion of the project, as stated in the introduction of the project description, this project has challenged me
to build a chess bot using decision trees from scratch (minus the alpha-beta pruning algorithm), which you can find it [here](https://github.com/arasgungore/chess-bot).
